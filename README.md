# Bruce Taylor's website (v2)

This is *version 2* of my personal website.

It's kind of an evolutionary piece of work that'll hopefully turn out to be something decent in the end. I intend to bump my head and learn a few things along the way. I going to try my best to enjoy the process rather than just the finished product.

## Things I'd like to do

1. Build it using a Static Site Generator (SSG) of sorts. Considering...
   * [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/) ✔️
   * ~~[Sergey](https://sergey.cool/)~~
2. I don't want to use a task builder abstraction like Grunt or Gulp (if I can!). I just want to use NPM scripts as much as I can.
   * There may be a more up-to-date article but this [using npm as a build system](https://medium.com/@drublic/using-npm-as-a-build-system-for-your-next-project-2c741e9381eb) article is a good starting point
3. Use *newer* CSS methods like...
   * [Custom CSS Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*)
   * [Variable fonts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Fonts/Variable_Fonts_Guide)
   * [CSS Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout)
        - [Inspiration example](https://andy-bell.design/wrote/create-a-responsive-grid-layout-with-no-media-queries-using-css-grid/)
4. I'll try to use less SCSS. Not that I don't like SCSS (*SASS*). I'm keen to make this site work with as little abstractions as I can.
5. Use a [Service Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API).
   - *I use a service worker on my current site but may try to enhance this implemenation*
6. Maybe try integrating [Fractal](https://fractal.build/) into the component build process.
7. Add a RSS feed.
