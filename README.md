# Bruce Taylor's website (v2)

This is *version 2* of my personal website. It's kind of an evolutionary piece of work that'll hopefully turn out to be something decent in the end. I intend to bump my head and learn a few things along the way.

## Things I'd like to do

1. Built it using a Static Site Generator (SSG) of sorts. Maybe...
   * [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/)
   * [Sergey](https://sergey.cool/)
2. Don't use a task builder abstraction like Grunt or Gulp. Just use NPM.
3. Use *newer* CSS methods like...
   * [Custom CSS Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*)
   * [Variable fonts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Fonts/Variable_Fonts_Guide)
   * [CSS Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout)
4. Use a [Service Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API).
   - *I use a service worker on my current site but may try to enhance this implemenation*
5. Maybe try integrating [Fractal](https://fractal.build/) into the component build process
6. Add a RSS feed.
