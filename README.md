# Bruce Taylor's website (v2)

This is *version 2* of my personal website.

## Things I'd like to do

* Built it using a Static Site Generator (SSG) of sorts. Maybe...
  * [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/)
  * [Sergey](https://sergey.cool/)
* Don't use a task builder abstraction like Grunt or Gulp. Just use NPM.
* Use *newer* CSS methods like...
  * [Custom CSS Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*)
  * [Variable fonts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Fonts/Variable_Fonts_Guide)
  * [CSS Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout)
* Use a [Service Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API).
  - *I use a service worker on my current site but may try to enhance this implemenation*
* Maybe try integrating [Fractal](https://fractal.build/) into the component build process
