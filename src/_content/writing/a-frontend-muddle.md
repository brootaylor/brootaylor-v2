If you're someone who builds websites on the front-end – (*trying to stay away from labels!*) – and you find yourself getting in a muddle about what that entails these days, here are a few articles I think are important reads:

---

* [HTML, CSS and our vanishing industry entry points][1] — *Rachel Andrew*
* [The Great Divide][2] — *Chris Coyier*
* [Defining Productivity][3] — *Jeremy Wagner*
* [Dev perception][4] — *Jeremy Keith*
* [Split][5] — *Jeremy Keith*

---

Some of them link to each other but I thought I'd list them out individually anyway.

I unapologetically share links to 2 articles by Jeremy Keith as I think they hit the nail on the head.
