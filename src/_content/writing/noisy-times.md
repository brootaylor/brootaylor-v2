lead: "These are odd times for sure and too often I’m finding myself mulling over all sorts of 'what-ifs'. Most of which I have no way of controlling anyway; and yet they can end up taking up a big chunk of space in my mind and sapping my energy."

Then there’s the ‘background noise’. I don’t necessarily mean the television or playstation - (thanks teenage kids!) - but life’s background noise.

The noise of the news. The noise of social media channels like Twitter. The noise of worry for friends and family - it doesn’t help that I lost a dear friend to Covid-19. The noise of guilt; guilt of not being in touch with my family and friends as much as I could/should. The noise of concern for my teenage sons and how the future looks to pan out for them. The noise of feeling helpless, stuck and like I’m floating around in some weird parallel universe. It all contributes to a din that just seems to be getting louder and louder. One that I’m finding increasingly difficult to tune out of.

There's some words in one of Lauren Alaina’s songs that helped me gain a little perspective.

> Once I get a little older, I won't worry  
  Then you get older and it don't feel like it should  
  I'm thinking once I learn to grow right where I'm planted  
  Maybe that's when life starts getting good.”
