lead: "These are strange times for sure and all too often I’m finding myself overly concerned with the future and primarily its potential outworking for my kids. Most of which I have no way of controlling anyway; and yet these thoughts can end up taking up a big chunk of space in my mind and sapping me of energy."

I have no doubt the ‘background noise’ isn’t helping my sanity levels either. I don’t necessarily mean the television or playstation - (thanks teenage kids!) - but life’s relentless background noise.

The noise of&hellip;

&hellip;**the news**.

&hellip;**social media** channels like Twitter - (I’ve deleted the app again!).

&hellip;**worry for friends and family** - it doesn’t help that [I lost a dear friend to Covid-19][1].

&hellip;**guilt**; guilt of not being in touch with my family and friends as much as I feel I could/should.

&hellip;**feeling helpless**, stuck and as though I’m floating around in some weird parallel universe.

&hellip;**feeling disconnected**. Even though we have all this technology that helps us ‘connect’, I feel more disconnected that ever. I’m Zoom-ed out. Gosh I miss being able to hug a friend.

This all contributes to a din that just seems to be getting louder and louder. One that I’m finding increasingly difficult to tune out of. I end up flirting with hopelessness and wondering how this world, (that seems to have lost the plot), will ever find its balance again.

Oof! Not the most cheerful of posts I know. It's more a case of me dumping some clumsy thoughts in a clumsy time and hoping&hellip; hoping that I can keep a smidgen of hope alive.

At least for today anyhow.
