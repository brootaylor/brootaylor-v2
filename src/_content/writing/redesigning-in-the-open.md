I've decided to take the scary route of redesigning and developing my website in the open. I've been inspired by others that have done this and thought it may be an interesting process. Not least because I'm a bit of a perfectionist and doing this may be a good way of weaning me off the need to have things completely polished before showing them. ðŸ˜±

My hope is this'll be a evolutionary piece of work rather than the usual "WHALA!" moment. I intend to bump my head (a lot!) and learn a fair few things along the way - and am going to try my best to enjoy the whole process rather than just looking forward to it being 'finished'.

You're more than welcome to follow along if you're ok with witnessing the inevitable head-scratching and "WT...*" moments ðŸ¤ª.

I say this gingerly but I'd be honoured if anyone wanted to contribute any thoughts and pearls of wisdom. All I ask is you be kind.

I've [made the code public][5]. All I ask is you keep in mind this code is for my personal website - so please can I ask you not to copy the code wholesale. By all means learn from it (as I'm doing). Thank you.

The website is comprised of static files built using the wonderful [Eleventy][1], [NPM][2] scripts defined in `package.json` as well as [rollup.js][3] to bundle JavaScript modules. It is deployed by and hosted with [Netlify][4].
