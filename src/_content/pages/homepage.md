Originally from South Africa but now living in West Sussex, England. Here's a bit more [about me][1].

I make websites and have worked on various projects with companies like **AirMiles**, **Avios**, **Macmillan Cancer Support**, **Pegasus**, **Time Inc.**, **MerchantCantos**, **Euromoney** and more recently with [IAG Loyalty][2].

***

I sometimes [write][3], jot down [notes][4] or share [links][5] to things that interest me.

[Eleventy][6], [Netlify][7] and [Fractal][8] are proving really enjoyable to work with and have restored some of the magic of building websites again.

I'm reading a few books (actual paper!) at the moment - but the one I'm particularly enjoying is "[Everything is Spiritual][9]" by Rob Bell.
