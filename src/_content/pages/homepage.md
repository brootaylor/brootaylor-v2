Most recently I worked with [IAG Loyalty](https://iagloyalty.com/) but have also worked with companies like **Airmiles UK**, **Avios**, **Macmillan Cancer Support**, **Pegasus**, **Charanga Music**, **Time Inc.**, **Analog Implant Laboratory**, **Boston T Party**, **MerchantCantos** and **Euromoney**.

***

I place a high value on user-centricity. That is, I strive to develop web experiences that look and work well on any device that can access the internet while also considering user demands and business objectives. Simultaneously laying a usable, accessible, responsive, performant, and resilient foundation for long-term success.

If this seems like something you're looking for and you think I might be able to help, [I'd love to hear from you](/contact).
