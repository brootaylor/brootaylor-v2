Originally from South Africa but now living in West Sussex, England. Here's a bit more [about me][1].

I make websites and have worked on various projects with companies like **AirMiles**, **Avios**, **Macmillan Cancer Support**, **Pegasus**, **Time Inc.**, **MerchantCantos**, **Euromoney** and more recently with [IAG Loyalty][2].

***

I sometimes [write][3], jot down [notes][4] or share [links][5] to things that interest me.

At the moment, I'm reading "[The Universal Christ][7]" by Richard Rohr. There's so much good stuff in this book that I think I'll need to read it again.

I'm also busy dabbling with the fabulous [Eleventy][8], [Netlify][9], [Fractal][10] and [Vue.js][11].
