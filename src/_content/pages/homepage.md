Originally from South Africa but now living in West Sussex, England. Here's a bit more [about me][1].

I make websites and have worked on various projects with companies like **AirMiles**, **Avios**, **Macmillan Cancer Support**, **Pegasus**, **Time Inc.**, **MerchantCantos**, **Euromoney** and more recently with [IAG Loyalty][2].

***

I sometimes [write][3], jot down [notes][4] or share [links][5] to things that interest me.

[Eleventy][6], [Netlify][7], [Fractal][8] and [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) animation using [GreenSock](https://greensock.com/) are proving really enjoyable to work with and have restored some of the magic of building websites again.

There are a few books (actual paper!) on the go at the moment and just finished "[Everything is Spiritual][9]" by Rob Bell. I wholeheartedly recommend it.
