Most recently I worked with [IAG Loyalty](https://iagloyalty.com/) but have also worked with companies like **Airmiles UK**, **Avios**, **Macmillan Cancer Support**, **Pegasus**, **Charanga Music**, **Time Inc.**, **Analog Implant Laboratory**, **Boston T Party**, **MerchantCantos** and **Euromoney**.

User-centricity is important to me, which means I particularly enjoy building web interfaces that are usable, accessible, performant, resilient and as future-friendly as possible.

If this sounds like something you're after and think I could possibly help you with it, [I'd love to hear from you](/contact).
