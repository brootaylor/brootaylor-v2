Most recently I worked with [IAG Loyalty](https://iagloyalty.com/) but have also worked with companies like **Airmiles UK**, **Avios**, **Macmillan Cancer Support**, **Pegasus**, **Charanga Music**, **Time Inc.**, **Analog Implant Laboratory**, **Boston T Party**, **MerchantCantos** and **Euromoney**.

Do you think there's a web project that I could possibly help you with? Then I’d love to [hear from you](/contact) and find out a bit more about what you’re working on.
