Originally from South Africa but now living in West Sussex, England. Here's a bit more [about me](/about) and the [work that I do](/work).

I make websites and have worked on projects with companies and businesses like **AirMiles**, **Avios**, **Macmillan Cancer Support**, **Pegasus**, **Charanga Music**, **Analog Implant Laboratory**, **Time Inc.**, **MerchantCantos**, **Boston T Party**, **Euromoney** and most recently with [IAG Loyalty](https://iagloyalty.com/).

***

I sometimes [write](/writing), jot down [notes](/notes) or share [links](/links) to things that interest me.

[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Fractal](https://fractal.build/) and [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) animation using [GreenSock](https://greensock.com/) are proving really enjoyable to work with and have restored some of the magic of building websites again.

There are a few books (actual paper!) on the go at the moment. I'm finding "[Greenlights](https://greenlights.com/)" by Matthew McConaughey a pretty compelling read.
