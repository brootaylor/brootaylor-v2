Originally from South Africa but now living in West Sussex, England. Here's a bit more [about me][1].

I'm a Front End Web Designer &amp; Developer and have worked on a wide variety of projects with companies like **AirMiles**, **Avios**, **Macmillan Cancer Support**, **Pegasus**, **Time Inc.**, **MerchantCantos**, **Euromoney** and more recently with [IAG Loyalty][2].

I sometimes [write][3], jot down [notes][4] or share [links][5] to things that interest me.

At the moment, I'm reading "[Future Ethics][6]" by Cennydd Bowles and "[The Universal Christ][7]" by Richard Rohr.

I'm also busy dabbling with the fabulous [Eleventy][8], [Netlify][9] and [Fractal][10].
