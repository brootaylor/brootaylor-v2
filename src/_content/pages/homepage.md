## Hi, I'm Bruce

A Front End Web Designer &amp; Developer living in Crawley, West Sussex, UK. Here's a bit more <a href="{{ '/about' | url }}">about me</a>.

Over the years I've worked on a wide variety of projects with companies like **AirMiles**, **Macmillan Cancer Support**, **Time Inc.**, **MerchantCantos**, **Euromoney** and more recently with <a href="https://aviosgroup.com/" rel="external">Avios</a>.

<h2 class="visuallyhidden">What I'm up to</h2>

<ul class="bio-extra">
	<li>I sometimes <a href="/writing/">write</a>, jot down <a href="/notes/">notes</a> or share <a href="/links/">links</a> to things that interest me.</li>
	<li>At the moment, I'm reading "<a href="https://www.future-ethics.com/" rel="external">Future Ethics</a>" by Cennydd Bowles, "<a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup" rel="external">Shape Up</a>" by Ryan Singer and "<a href="https://universalchrist.cac.org/" rel="external">The Universal Christ</a>" by Richard Rohr.</li>
	<li>I'm also busy dabbling with the fabulous <a href="https://www.11ty.io/" rel="external">Eleventy</a> and <a href="https://fractal.build/" rel="external">Fractal</a>.</li>
</ul>
