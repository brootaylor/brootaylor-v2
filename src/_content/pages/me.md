  - I'm originally from South Africa and grew up on a dairy farm in a very <a href="https://youtu.be/bGQbM3QfA5w">beautiful part of the country</a>.
  - Before I ever touched a computer, my life revolved around teasing cows, off-road motorbiking, hiking and wild camping in the mountains, staring up at the stars, canoeing, fishing and sport.

My wife and I moved to the UK at the tail end of 1995 &mdash; initially for one year &mdash; but as you've probably gathered&hellip; we never left. We have 3 teenage children. 2 sons and a daughter.

I write now and then and have [written a few posts](/writing) on various things. Hopefully some of them will resonate.

## Some hobby stuff

<!-- Need to eventually point photos URL to my photo page (when it's built!) -->

I enjoy [taking photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/60226997@N06/) whenever I can and am a [fairly decent drummer](https://www.flickr.com/photos/60226997@N06/40548596663/). Fly fishing for trout is something I grew up doing and continue to do. I head to the beautiful [Lakedown Trout Fishery](https://www.lakedowntroutfishery.com/) as often as I can. A gorgeous and tranquil spot away from all the noise.

I absolutely [adore aircraft](https://www.flickr.com/photos/60226997@N06/47530443441/) and still plan to pull my finger out and get my <abbr title="Private Pilots Licence">PPL</abbr> one day.

## What I'm reading

I'm a sucker for fantasy. The feeling of been transported to another world is intoxicating. Currently I'm making my way through "[Dune](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44767458-dune)" by Frank Herbert.

Jeremy Wagner's "[Responsible JavaScript](https://abookapart.com/products/responsible-javascript)" is also on the go and I think it's a much needed read at this time in the web building industry.

William R. Catton's "[Overshoot: The Ecological Basis of Revolutionary Change](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/319810.Overshoot)" is blowing my mind quite a bit. I'd say I'm enjoying it but that wouldn't be truthful. I think it's more honest to say that it's probably turning out to be one of the most important reads of my life &ndash; but in a disturbingly and unnervingly profound sort of way.

Here's a selection of [books I've read](/reading) over the past few years.

## Webby stuff I'm enjoying

[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/), [Astro](https://astro.build/), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Fractal](https://fractal.build/) and [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) animation using [GreenSock](https://greensock.com/) are proving really enjoyable to work with and have restored some of the magic of building websites again.

## About this website

*Sorry. Not so much about me I know but loosely related nonetheless*. ðŸ™„

This website has been the home of my personal blog for a fair few years. Everything written here represents my opinions and perspectives on various things. It *doesn't* reflect or represent the views of anyone I work for or with.

I also use it as a platform for experimenting with newer frontend web technologies & techniques &mdash; so there's every chance it may look a little 'wonky' now and then. Please forgive me if something doesn't look quite right or work properly on your screen at the moment.

If you have any issues, questions or spot any spelling mistakes(!), I'd appreciate it if you could let me know by submitting a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/brootaylor/brootaylor-v2/issues), or by [emailing me directly](/contact).

I've also written about my decision to [redesign & develop my website in the open](/writing/2020-02-22/redesigning-in-the-open) which has both been fun and scary. Not least because I'm a bit of a perfectionist and doing it this way has helped wean me off the need to have things completely polished before showing them.

More information about the technology used to make this website is available in this [<code>humans.txt</code> file](https://brootaylor.com/humans.txt).

Thank you for dropping by.
