  - I'm originally from South Africa and grew up on a dairy farm in a very <a href="https://youtu.be/bGQbM3QfA5w">beautiful part of the country</a>.
  - Before I ever touched a computer, my life revolved around teasing cows, off-road motorbiking, hiking and camping in the mountains, canoeing, fishing and sport. Funny how things turn out sometimes.

My wife and I moved to the UK at the tail end of 1995 &mdash; initially for one year &mdash; but as you've probably gathered&hellip; we never left. We have 3 children. 2 teenage sons and a daughter.

I try and write whenever I get the chance and have [written a few posts](/writing) on various things. Here's hoping you'll like some of them or be able to relate to one or two of them in some way.

## Some hobby stuff

I enjoy landscape photography and am a [fairly decent drummer](https://www.flickr.com/photos/60226997@N06/40548596663/). Fly fishing for trout is something I grew up doing and continue to do. I head to the beautiful [Lakedown Trout Fishery](https://www.lakedowntroutfishery.com/) as often as I can. A gorgeous and tranquil spot away from all the noise.

I absolutely [adore aircraft](https://www.flickr.com/photos/60226997@N06/47530443441/) and still plan to pull my finger out and get my <abbr title="Private Pilots Licence">PPL</abbr> one day.

## What I'm reading

I'm a sucker for fantasy. The feeling of been transported to another world is intoxicating. Currently I'm making my way through the "[The Echoes Saga](https://www.philipcquaintrell.com/books)" by Philip C. Quaintrell. What a treat it's been.

## Webby stuff I'm enjoying

[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Fractal](https://fractal.build/) and [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) animation using [GreenSock](https://greensock.com/) are proving really enjoyable to work with and have restored some of the magic of building websites again.

Since the [announcement of Astro](https://astro.build/blog/introducing-astro), I've been really keen to get my teeth into it. The [CSS Tricks newsletter](https://css-tricks.com/newsletter/255-thoughts-on-astro/) and [Zell Liew](https://zellwk.com/blog/astro-thoughts/) have been singing its praises as well which has only further sparked my interest.

## About this website

This website has been the home of my personal blog for a fair few years. Everything written here represents my opinions and perspectives on various things. It *doesn't* reflect or represent the views of anyone I work for or with.

I also use it as a platform for experimenting with newer frontend web technologies & techniques &mdash; so there's every chance it may look a little 'wonky' now and then. Please forgive me if something doesn't look quite right or work properly on your screen at the moment.

If you have any issues, questions or spot any spelling mistakes(!), I'd appreciate it if you could let me know by submitting a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/brootaylor/brootaylor-v2/issues), or by [emailing me directly](/contact).

I've also written about my decision to [redesign & develop my website in the open](/writing/2020-02-22/redesigning-in-the-open) which has both been fun and scary. Not least because I'm a bit of a perfectionist and doing it this way has helped wean me off the need to have things completely polished before showing them.

Thank you for dropping by.
