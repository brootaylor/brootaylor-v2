My interest in all things webby began in late 1999 while working at the original [Boo.com][1]. After a brief stint of freelancing, I started at [Airmiles][2] in 2004 – which later became [Avios][3] – and ended up working their for 11 years.

Since then I've worked on a wide variety of projects with companies like Macmillan Cancer Support, Pegasus, Time Inc., MerchantCantos, Euromoney and more recently with [Avios][3] again.

I enjoy a team environment and am told I communicate and work well with technical and non-technical people alike. I've worked on all sorts of projects in small, medium and large multi-functional development teams – and have considerable experience in creating front-end code that's modular, responsive, performant, extensible, accessible and future friendly.

I frequently dabble with new technologies and try my best to find neat solutions to complex problems. I believe the websites we design and build should be as [usable as possible no matter the context][4]. I'm therefore particularly interested in [responsive web design][5], [progressive enhancement][6], [progressive web apps][7], [web standards][8] and [web accessibility][9].

## Personal stuff

I'm originally from South Africa and grew up on a dairy farm in a very [beautiful part of the country][10]. Before I ever touched a computer, my life revolved around teasing cows, off-road motorbiking, hiking in the mountains, canoeing, fishing and sport. Funny how things turn out sometimes eh!

I enjoy landscape photography and am a [fairly decent drummer][11]. I absolutely [adore aircraft][12] and still plan to pull my finger out and get my PPL one day.

My wife and I moved to the UK at the tail end of 1995 &mdash; initially for one year &mdash; but as you've probably gathered&hellip; we never left. We have 3 children. 2 teenage sons and an 11 year old daughter.

I try and write whenever I get the chance and have [written a few posts][13] on various things. Here's hoping you'll like some of them or be able to relate to one or two of them in some way.

## About this website

This website has been the home of my personal blog for a fair few years. Everything written here represents my opinions and perspectives on various things. It doesn't reflect or represent the views of anyone I work for or with.

I also use it as a platform for experimenting with newer front-end web technologies – so there's every chance it may look a little 'wonky' now and then. Please forgive me if something doesn't look quite right on your screen at the moment.

Thank you for dropping by.
