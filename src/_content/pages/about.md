## What I do

I primarily work on the "[front-of-the-front-end](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/)". This is my preference and certainly plays to my strengths. However, I'm often found with my hands in the "*back-of-the-front-end*" and DevOps stuff as well - (eg. JavaScript bundlers, deployment tooling, <abbr title="Continuous Integration">CI</abbr>/<abbr title="Continuous Deployment">CD</abbr> etc.).

I spend a lot of my time writing / creating the HTML, CSS, and presentational JavaScript code that makes up a user interface. User-centricity is very important to me when developing a web solution. Which means I have a keen focus on [responsive design](https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design) & [intrinsic design](https://talks.jensimmons.com/15TjNW), [progressive enhancement](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/using-progressive-enhancement), [semantic markup](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G115.html), [accessibility](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/), [web standards](https://www.w3.org/standards/) and [performance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Performance).

My aim is to build web solutions that are [resilient](https://resilientwebdesign.com/), [usable](https://trentwalton.com/2014/03/10/device-agnostic/) and as future-friendly as possible. For this reason I *prefer* a vanilla approach and tend to steer clear of using JavaScript frameworks if I can help it. Not that I have anything against JavaScript frameworks. I think they can be wonderfully powerful tools if we first keep the user in mind rather than prioritising the developer experience. At the moment I don't think we're getting that balance quite right.

Saying that, I think frameworks like [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [Astro](https://astro.build/), (and possibly [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)), are helping redress this imbalance.

## Am I a *Fullstack* Developer?

Nope, I wouldn't call myself a *Fullstack* Developer.

Personally it doesn't interest me much either. I love working on the frontend (HTML, CSS & JS) and that's where I've spent the most time honing my skills.

## Am I a designer?

I'm not a designer per se, but I love the design side of things.

My role often involves collaborating with designers to ensure that the design translates as well as it can into the browser &mdash; regardless of the user's context and how they choose to navigate the web interface (eg. screen reader, mobile phone, browser of choice, etc.).
