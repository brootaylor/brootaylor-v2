## What I do

I'm a **Frontend Web Developer**.

There are other names you may have come across that try to describe this role &mdash; like Frontend Designer, UI Developer, UI Engineer and Design Engineer.

Breaking my role down a bit further; I primarily work on the "[front-of-the-front-end](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/)". This is my preference and certainly plays to my strengths. However, I'm *occasionally* found with my hands in the "back-of-the-front-end" and DevOps - (eg. JavaScript bundlers, deployment tooling, CI/CD etc.) - stuff as well.

I spend a lot of my time writing / creating the HTML, CSS, and presentational JavaScript code that makes up a user interface. This is tightly coupled with a focus on [responsive design](https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design), [progressive enhancement](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/using-progressive-enhancement), [semantic markup](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G115.html), [accessibility](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/), [web standards](https://www.w3.org/standards/) and [performance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Performance). My aim is always to build web solutions that are as [resilient](https://resilientwebdesign.com/), [usable](https://trentwalton.com/2014/03/10/device-agnostic/) and future-friendly as possible.

### Are you a *Fullstack Developer*?

I realise some *may* read what I wrote earlier and ask&hellip; "Wouldn't you call yourself a *Fullstack Developer* then?".

Nope, I wouldn't.

I've often struggled with that title anyway &mdash; and even more so these days. Not least because of the *unrealistic* expectations that accompany it; but also because building websites has become increasingly complex and it's virtually impossible to be competent - (let alone an expert) - across the entire stack.

Personally it doesn't interest me much either. I love working on the frontend (HTML, CSS & JS) and that's where I've spent the most time honing my skills.

### Are you a designer?
I'm not a designer per se, but I love the design side of things. My role often involves collaborating with designers to ensure that the design translates as well as it can into the browser &mdash; regardless of the user's context and how they choose to navigate the web interface (eg. screen reader, mobile phone, browser of choice, etc.).

## Web tech I'm enjoying

[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Fractal](https://fractal.build/) and [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) animation using [GreenSock](https://greensock.com/) are proving really enjoyable to work with and have restored some of the magic of building websites again.

Since the [announcement of Astro](https://astro.build/blog/introducing-astro), I've been really keen to get my teeth into it. The [CSS Tricks newsletter](https://css-tricks.com/newsletter/255-thoughts-on-astro/) and [Zell Liew](https://zellwk.com/blog/astro-thoughts/) have been singing its praises as well which has only further sparked my interest.

## What I *don't* do

It's probably worth mentioning some of the things I'm not interested in. Hopefully this will help you better decide whether to contact me about a work opportunity or not.

Things like&hellip;

* **You're looking for a “quick website”**. Sorry, I don't do rush work.
* **You're looking around for the lowest price**. This is always an alarm bell for me I'm afraid. I don't really do '*cheap and cheerful*'.
* **You need a designer to design your Website / App UI**. I do love design. However, I am not a designer. I work with designers by bringing my strengths to the '*engineering*' side.
