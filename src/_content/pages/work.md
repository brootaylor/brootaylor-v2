## What I do

Nowadays I work as an independent front-end web developer. I've worked onvarious web projects with companies and businesses like **Macmillan Cancer Support**, **Pegasus**, **Charanga Music**, **Analog Implant Laboratory**, **Time Inc.**,
**MerchantCantos**, **Boston T Party**, **Euromoney** and most recently with [IAG Loyalty](https://iagloyalty.com/).

I enjoy a team environment and am told I communicate and work well with technical and non-technical people alike. I've
worked on all sorts of projects in small, medium and large multi-functional development teams – and have considerable
experience in creating front-end code that's modular, responsive, performant, extensible, accessible and future
friendly.

I frequently dabble with new technologies and try my best to find neat solutions to complex problems. I believe the
websites we design and build should be as [usable as possible no matter the
context](https://trentwalton.com/2014/03/10/device-agnostic/). I'm therefore particularly interested in [responsive web
design](https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design), [progressive
enhancement](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/using-progressive-enhancement), [progressive web
apps](https://julian.is/article/progressive-web-apps/), [web standards](https://www.w3.org/standards/) and [web
accessibility](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/).
