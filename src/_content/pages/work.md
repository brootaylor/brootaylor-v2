## What I do

I'm a Frontend Web Developer and UI Engineer.

Breaking my role down a bit further; I primarily work on the "[front-of-the-front-end](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/)". This is my preference and certainly plays to my strengths. However, I'm often found with my hands in the "back-of-the-front-end" and DevOps stuff as well - (eg. JavaScript bundlers, deployment tooling, <abbr title="Continuous Integration">CI</abbr>/<abbr title="Continuous Deployment">CD</abbr> etc.).

I spend a lot of my time writing / creating the HTML, CSS, and presentational JavaScript code that makes up a user interface. This is tightly coupled with a focus on [responsive design](https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design), [progressive enhancement](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/using-progressive-enhancement), [semantic markup](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G115.html), [accessibility](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/), [web standards](https://www.w3.org/standards/) and [performance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Performance). My aim is to build web solutions that are as [resilient](https://resilientwebdesign.com/), [usable](https://trentwalton.com/2014/03/10/device-agnostic/) and future-friendly as possible.

### Am I a *Fullstack* Developer?

Nope, I wouldn't call myself a *Fullstack* Developer.

I've often struggled with that title anyway &mdash; and even more so these days. Not least because of the unrealistic expectations that often accompany it; but also because building websites has become increasingly complex and it's virtually impossible to be competent - (let alone an expert) - across an entire technology stack.

Personally it doesn't interest me much either. I love working on the frontend (HTML, CSS & JS) and that's where I've spent the most time honing my skills. User-centricity is also very important to me when developing a web solution.

### Am I a designer?

I'm not a designer per se, but I love the design side of things. My role often involves collaborating with designers to ensure that the design translates as well as it can into the browser &mdash; regardless of the user's context and how they choose to navigate the web interface (eg. screen reader, mobile phone, browser of choice, etc.).

## A few things I *wouldn't* be interested in doing

It's probably worth mentioning some of the things I'm not interested in working on. Hopefully this will help you better decide whether to contact me about a work opportunity or not.

Things like&hellip;

* **You're looking for a “quick website”**. Sorry, I don't do rush work.
* **You're looking around for the lowest price**. This is always an alarm bell for me I'm afraid. I don't really do '*cheap and cheerful*'.
* **You need a designer to design your Website / App UI**. I do love design. However, I am not a designer. I work with designers by bringing my strengths to the '*engineering*' side of UI creation.
