## Nice things people have said

{%- call blockquote('Stephen Scott, Chief Digital Officer, IAG Loyalty') -%}
  Bruce is a true digital native. Starting in the industry back as far as Boo.com and continually striving to push the boundaries of front end code design. He takes it upon himself to continually keep up to date with the latest trends and to apply that to his work to the benefit of whoever he is working for. I have no hesitation in recommending Bruce for any role in which pushing your digital boundaries is at the core of your agenda.

  Bruce is great addition to any team, a great personality who requires minimal management and produces accurate and attractive output. He keeps up to date with the latest techniques and is happy to share those skills with others. I wouldn't hesitate in giving Bruce another opportunity when one arises.
