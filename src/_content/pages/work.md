## What I do

Nowadays I work as an independent Frontend Web Developer.

Titles for the work I do seem to go by many names these days &mdash; like Frontend Designer, UI Developer, UI Engineer and Design Engineer. It's hard to keep up and can be a little exhausting. So, in a nutshell (if that's possible!) I would say I primary work on the "[front-of-the-frontend](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/)". This is my preference and certainly plays to my strengths but I do also occasionally get my hands into the "back-of-the-frontend" as well.

I primarily spend my time writing / creating the HTML, CSS, and presentational JavaScript code that makes up a user interface. This is tightly coupled with a focus on [responsive design](https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design), [progressive enhancement](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/using-progressive-enhancement), [semantic markup](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G115.html), [accessibility](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/), [web standards](https://www.w3.org/standards/) and performance. My aim is always to build web solutions that are as [resilient](https://resilientwebdesign.com/), [usable](https://trentwalton.com/2014/03/10/device-agnostic/) and future friendly as possible.

I'm not a designer per se, but I love the design side of things. My roles often involve collaborating with designers to ensure that the design translates as well as it can into the browser &mdash; regardless of the user's context and how they choose to use it (eg. screen reader, mobile phone, browser of choice, etc.).
