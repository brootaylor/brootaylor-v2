Am also considering dipping my toe in the [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) pond. In particular the <abbr title="Server-Side Rendering">SSR</abbr> side of things and the <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getserversideprops-server-side-rendering"><code>getServerSideProps</code></a> facility it provides when needing authenticated areas on an <abbr title="Static Site Generator">SSG</abbr> site.

But who knows when I'll find time for that!
