Thank you Rachel for writing this.

An important reminder that you can take time off &mdash; even extended time off &mdash; from the fast-moving frontend world and still come back and be alright.

> What I’ve learnt through experience is that **the number of languages I’ve learned or the specific frameworks I’ve gained experience with matters very little. What actually matters is my ability to up-skill quickly and effectively**. My success so far has nothing to do with the fact I know React instead of Vue, or have experience with AWS and not Azure. What has contributed to my success is the willingness to learn new tools as the need arises.
