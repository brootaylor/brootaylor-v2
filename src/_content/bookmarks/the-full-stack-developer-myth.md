I too have struggled with the idea of the *full stack* developer for years and years so found a fair bit of sanity in this article by Chris Ferdinandi.

Most of the article is highlighting what [Charlie Owen tweeted in this thread](https://twitter.com/whalecoiner/status/1405097520582299650). I almost found myself cheering allowed to each tweet.

Here's a taster:

> Do I consider myself full stack? No! My generalist knowledge exists to assist my core skills.

And another:

> There’s a reason why we don’t have handymen building houses. They might know a bit of everything, but you don’t let them build a structure meant to last centuries.
>
> Similarly we don’t let generalists build robust sites and apps that are meant for all.

Read the entire thread if you can. It's brilliant stuff.
