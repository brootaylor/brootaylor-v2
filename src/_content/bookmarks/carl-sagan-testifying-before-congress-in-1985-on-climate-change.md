**35 years on** and these 15 or so minutes of what Carl Sagan had to say are more relevant than ever.

And his closing statement, worringly, feels more out of reach than ever:

> I think that what is essential for this problem is a global consciousness. A view that transcends our exclusive identifications with the generational and political groupings into which by accident we have been born. The solution to these problems requires a perspective that embraces the planet and the future because we are all in this greenhouse together.
