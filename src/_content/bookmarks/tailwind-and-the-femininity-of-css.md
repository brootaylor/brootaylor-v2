Another fab article by Chris Ferdinandi.

He starts off by saying this:

> Is the implication that vanilla JS literally cannot handle the load of large applications the way frameworks can? That’s obviously untrue, as every single framework is powered by vanilla JS under-the-hood. They can only work “at scale” if vanilla JS can as well.

Read the whole article if you can. As always it's so well thought out and articulated by Chris.
