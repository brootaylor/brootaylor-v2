Oof, this article by Remy Sharpe hit me right in the gut. In a good way.

Like this&hellip;

> Web development did not change. Web development grew. There are more options now, not different options.

And this&hellip;

> The problem with developing front end projects isn't that it's harder or more complicated, it's that you made it harder and more complicated.

Thanks for administering some much needed smelling salts Remy.
