Bastian Allgeier wonderfully articulates what many – (more than likely most!) – of us are probably thinking anyway but unsure whether we should break cover or not.

Things like...

> When you ever had to fix just a few lines of CSS and it took two hours to get an ancient version of Gulp up and running, you know what I’m talking about.

And...

> When everything works, it feels like magic. When something breaks, it’s hell.

One more cau... well, just cause.

> This dependency hell is also the reason why old projects are almost like sealed capsules. You can hardly let a project lie around for more than a year, because afterwards it’s probably broken.

Thank you Bastian!
