# PWA (Progressive Web App) assets

The files in this directory are needed to enable this web solution to behave like a [PWA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps).

Because this particular web solution is multilingual, there are 2 `manifest` files in the root of the `src` directory. Namely `manifest-en.json.njk` and `manifest-es.json.njk` - for english and spanish versions of the site respectively. The output `manifest-en.json` and `manifest-es.json` respectively.
