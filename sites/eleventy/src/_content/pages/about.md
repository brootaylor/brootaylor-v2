Before I ever touched a computer, my life revolved around teasing cows, off-road motorbiking, hiking and wild camping in the mountains, staring up at the stars, canoeing, fishing and sport. That certainly feels like quite some time ago now&hellip; ü§î

My wife and I moved to the UK at the tail end of 1995 &mdash; *initially for one year* &mdash; but as you've probably gathered&hellip; we never left. We have 3 children. 2 sons and a daughter.

I write now and then &ndash; and have [written a few posts](/writing), [jotted down some notes](/notes), and [bookmarked links to articles](/bookmarks) I've enjoyed and found interesting. Hopefully some of them will resonate with you.

## What I do

I build websites and have been doing so for around two decades.

I specialise in the "[front-of-the-front-end](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/)". The somewhat broad and *fuzzy* intersection between design and back-end engineering. I find I‚Äôm well suited to and enjoy roles that balance the user & developer experiences, empowering teams to write great code in a way that feels right to them while ensuring a positive user experience. {.call-out}

I'm quite good at picking up new skills and programming languages, as well as problem solving. My skill set is diverse, encompassing HTML, CSS, JS *(progressively enhanced)*, responsive design, themeable design system configuration, Progressive Web Apps (**PWA**), Static Site Generation (**SSG**), web performance optimisation, and web accessibility.

From time to time, you‚Äôll also find me with my hands in the ‚Äú*back-of-the-front-end*‚Äù utilising  Node.js, configuring an API, optimising a JavaScript bundler, as well as streamlining build and deployment processes to help improve frontend development efficiency.

I try my best to build web solutions that are [resilient](https://resilientwebdesign.com/), [usable](https://trentwalton.com/2014/03/10/device-agnostic/) and as future-friendly as possible. For this reason I *prefer* a vanilla approach and tend to be fairly tech-agnostic. Choosing the *right* tool for the job seems to be a better approach than using a framework for the sake of it. {.call-out}

Don't get me wrong, JavaScript frameworks certainly have their place and I think they can be wonderfully powerful tools when we keep the end user in mind &mdash; rather than *only* prioritising the developer experience. At the moment I'm not sure we're getting that balance quite right.

  Stick to boring architecture for as long as possible, and spend the majority of your time, and resources, building something your customers are willing to pay for.
{%- endcall %}

Here's a bit more about some of the [people I've worked with](/work) and what we've built together.

## Am I a designer?

While I can design and do love the design side of things, I'm not a designer per se.

These days, my role often involves collaborating with designers to ensure that the design translates as well as it can into the browser &mdash; regardless of the end user's context and how they *choose* to navigate the web interface (eg. screen reader, mobile phone, browser of choice, etc.).

## Webby stuff I'm enjoying

[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/), [Astro](https://astro.build/), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [Preact](https://preactjs.com/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/), [Fractal](https://fractal.build/), [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) animation using [GreenSock](https://greensock.com/), and [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) are proving really enjoyable to work with and have restored some of the magic of building websites again.

## Hobbies & other interests

I enjoy [taking photos](/photos) and [reading](/reading) whenever I can and am a [fairly decent drummer](/photos/2022-03-29/photo_202203292358). However, now that I've [sold my drumkit](/photos/2022-04-06/photo_202204062304), I am considering picking up the bass guitar.

Fly fishing for trout is something I grew up doing and continue to do. I head to the beautiful [Lakedown Trout Fishery](https://www.lakedowntroutfishery.com/) as often as I can. A gorgeous and tranquil spot away from all the noise.

I absolutely adore flying and hope that one day I'll be able to either get my PPL or GPL.

## About this website

This website has been the home of my personal blog for a fair few years. Everything written here represents my opinions and perspectives on various things. It *doesn't* reflect or represent the views of anyone I work for or with.

I also use it as a platform for experimenting with newer frontend web technologies & techniques &mdash; so there's every chance it may look a little 'wonky' now and then. Please forgive me if something doesn't look quite right or work properly on your screen at the moment.

I resonate with Ethan when he says, [let a website be a worry stone](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/let-a-website-be-a-worry-stone/). {.call-out}

If you have any issues, questions or spot any spelling mistakes(!), I'd appreciate it if you could let me know by submitting a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/brootaylor/brootaylor-v2/issues), or by [emailing me directly](/contact).

I've also written about my decision to [redesign & develop my website in the open](/writing/2022-02-22/redesigning-in-the-open) which has both been fun and scary. Not least because I'm a bit of a perfectionist and doing it this way has helped wean me off the need to have things completely polished before showing them.

More information about the technology used to make this website is available in this [<code>humans.txt</code> file](https://brootaylor.com/humans.txt).
