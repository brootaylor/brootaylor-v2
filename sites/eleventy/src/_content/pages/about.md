Before I ever touched a computer, my life revolved around teasing cows, off-road motorbiking, hiking and wild camping in the mountains, staring up at the stars, canoeing, fishing and sport. That certainly feels like quite some time ago now!

My wife and I moved to the UK at the tail end of 1995 &mdash; *initially for one year* &mdash; but as you've probably gathered&hellip; we never left. We have 3 children. 2 sons and a daughter.

I write now and then &ndash; and have [written a few posts](/writing), [jotted down some notes](/notes), and [bookmarked links to articles](/bookmarks) I've enjoyed and found interesting. Hopefully some of them will resonate with you.

## What I do

I build websites and have been doing so for around two decades.

I specialise in the "[front-of-the-front-end](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/)". The somewhat broad and *fuzzy* intersection between design and back-end engineering. I find I’m well suited to and enjoy roles that balance the user & developer experiences, empowering teams to write great code in a way that feels right to them while ensuring a positive user experience. {.call-out}

I'm quite good at picking up new skills and programming languages, as well as problem solving. My skill set is fairly diverse, encompassing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, responsive & device-agnostic web design, themeable design system configuration, Progressive Web Apps (**PWA**), Static Site Generation (**SSG**), web performance optimisation, and web accessibility.

From time to time, you’ll also find me with my hands in the “*back-of-the-front-end*” utilising  Node.js, configuring an API, optimising a JavaScript bundler, as well as streamlining build and deployment processes to help improve frontend development efficiency.

I try my best to build web solutions that are [resilient](https://resilientwebdesign.com/), [usable](https://trentwalton.com/2014/03/10/device-agnostic/) and as future-friendly as possible. For this reason I *prefer* a vanilla approach and tend to be fairly tech-agnostic. Choosing the *right* tool for the job seems to be a better approach than using a framework for the sake of it. {.call-out}

Don't get me wrong, JavaScript frameworks certainly have their place and I think they can be wonderfully powerful tools when we keep the end user in mind &mdash; rather than *only* prioritising the developer experience. At the moment I'm not sure we're getting that balance quite right.

## Webby stuff I'm enjoying

[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/), [Astro](https://astro.build/), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [Preact](https://preactjs.com/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/), [Fractal](https://fractal.build/), [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) animation using [GreenSock](https://greensock.com/), and [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) are proving really enjoyable to work with and have restored some of the magic of building websites again.

## Hobbies & other interests

I enjoy [taking photos](/photos) and [reading](/reading) whenever I can and am a [fairly decent drummer](/photos/2022-03-29/photo_202203292358). However, now that I've [sold my drumkit](/photos/2022-04-06/photo_202204062304), I am considering picking up the bass guitar.

Fly fishing for trout is something I grew up doing and continue to do. I head to the beautiful [Lakedown Trout Fishery](https://www.lakedowntroutfishery.com/) as often as I can. A gorgeous and tranquil spot away from all the noise.

I absolutely adore flying and hope that one day I'll be able to either get my PPL or GPL.

## About this website

This website has been the home of my personal blog for a fair few years. Everything written here represents my opinions and perspectives on various things. It *doesn't* reflect or represent the views of anyone I work for or with.

I also use it as a platform for experimenting with newer frontend web technologies & techniques &mdash; so there's every chance it may look a little 'wonky' now and then. Please forgive me if something doesn't look quite right or work properly on your screen at the moment.

I resonate with Ethan when he says, [let a website be a worry stone](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/let-a-website-be-a-worry-stone/). {.call-out}

If you have any issues, questions or spot any spelling mistakes(!), I'd appreciate it if you could let me know by submitting a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/brootaylor/brootaylor-v2/issues), or by [emailing me directly](/contact).

I've also written about my decision to [redesign & develop my website in the open](/writing/2022-02-22/redesigning-in-the-open) which has both been fun and scary. Not least because I'm a bit of a perfectionist and doing it this way has helped wean me off the need to have things completely polished before showing them.

### Crawlers & tracking

Even though it's more than likely [too late & doesn't work anyway](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/robots-txt/), I've attempted to opt `brootaylor.com` out of its content being used to train AI models. Known web crawlers used for training AI models are disallowed in my [<code>robots.txt</code> file](https://brootaylor.com/robots.txt).

I've also set up a machine-readable [<code>ai.txt</code> file](https://brootaylor.com/ai.txt), using [Spawning.ai's proposed format](https://site.spawning.ai/spawning-ai-txt). There's no real evidence that it has any traction in the land-of-the-web *yet* &mdash; but I thought why not.

More information about the technology used to make this website is available in this [<code>humans.txt</code> file](https://brootaylor.com/humans.txt).

It's probably worth mentioning that I don't use any tracking technologies &mdash; (*home-grown or third-party*) &mdash; to collect information about what you read or click on this website.
