      Bruce is a true digital native. Starting in the industry back as far as Boo.com and continually striving to push the boundaries of front end code design. He takes it upon himself to continually keep up to date with the latest trends and to apply that to his work to the benefit of whoever he is working for. I have no hesitation in recommending Bruce for any role in which pushing your digital boundaries is at the core of your agenda.

      Bruce was an excellent resource for us, taking on additional work when our internal resources were at capacity. He's easy to work with and always turned around work quickly and to a high standard. Bruce quickly became part of the family and overcoming challenges with ease due to his can-do attitude and tireless commitment to projects.

      We got Bruce in to to help us develop a front-end boilerplate / component library as we were inundated with projects and needed a safe pair of hands that could help us achieve quality results with minimal supervision. Bruce delivered a high-quality framework that ticks all of the boxes for us. And to top it all he’s a great guy to work with, highly professional, he gets on well with everyone and really cares about his work. I would not hesitate to hire Bruce again.
