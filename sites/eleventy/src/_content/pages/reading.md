Because I've never kept a list of my reads, I've ended up creating a bit of a challenge for myself that's for sure. Trying to recall all the books I've read and enjoyed feels like a bit of a daunting task but I'm keen to at least make a stab at it.

I'll be adding to the *"Have read"* section as and when I remember any books I've read cause it seems a little lean at the moment.
