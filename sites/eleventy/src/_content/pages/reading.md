Because I've never kept a list of my reads &mdash; *(naughty I know!)* &mdash; I've ended up creating a bit of a challenge for myself that's for sure. Trying to recall all the books I've read and enjoyed feels like a bit of a daunting task but I'm keen to at least make a decent stab at it.

I'll be adding to the *"Have Read"* section as and when I remember any books I've read.
