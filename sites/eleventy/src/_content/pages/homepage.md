I mostly work on the "[front-of-the-front-end](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/)" and find I'm well suited to roles that balance the user and developer experiences. I enjoy roles that both empower the team to write great code in whatever way feels right to them as well as ensuring that this does not negatively impact the user experience. {.call-out}

Even though I've done this web building thing for a while now, I certainly haven't got it all figured out. I'm still learning and I'm guessing you are as well.
