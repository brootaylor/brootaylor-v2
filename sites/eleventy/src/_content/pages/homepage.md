# Populates the `meta description` for a page
summary: "Bruce lives in West Sussex, England with his family. He's a Frontend Developer / UI Engineer with nearly 2 decades of experience trying his best to help people build websites that stand the test of time."

# Populates the opening / `lead` text on a page
lead:
  - I build websites and have been doing so for around two decades. People who do what I do are often referred to as <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/frontend-design/">Frontend Designers</a>, UI Developers, UI Engineers or <a href="https://snook.ca/archives/opinion/design-engineering">Design Engineers</a>.
  - I mostly work on the "<a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/">front-of-the-front-end</a>". The somewhat <strong><em>fuzzy</em></strong> intersection between design and back-end engineering.

I find Iâ€™m well suited to and enjoy roles that balance the user & developer experiences and empower the team to write great code in whatever way feels right to them, while ensuring that the user experience is not negatively impacted. {.call-out}

Even though I've done this web building thing for a while now, I certainly haven't got it all figured out. I'm still learning and I'm guessing you are as well.
