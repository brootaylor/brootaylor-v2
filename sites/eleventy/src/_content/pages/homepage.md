From time to time, you‚Äôll also find me with my hands in the ‚Äú*back-of-the-front-end*‚Äù &mdash; playing with Node.js, configuring an API, fiddling with JavaScript bundlers, <abbr title="Static site generators.">SSG's</abbr> and web frameworks ([11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), [Astro](https://astro.build/) & [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)), and trying my best to streamline build and deployment processes to help boost frontend development efficiency.

I find I‚Äôm well suited to and ***enjoy roles that balance the user & developer experiences***, empowering teams to write great code in a way that feels right to them while ensuring a positive user experience. {.call-out}

Even though I've done this web building thing for a while now, I certainly haven't got it all figured out. I'm still learning and I imagine you are as well.
