User-centricity is important to me. In other words, I try my best to create web experiences that look and function well on any device that can connect to the internet, while also considering user needs and business goals.

Even though I've done this web building thing for a while now, I'm still learning. I'm sure you are too. So, if you think I may be able to help out with your next project, please [get in touch](/contact).
