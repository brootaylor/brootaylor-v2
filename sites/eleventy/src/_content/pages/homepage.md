I specialise in the "[front-of-the-front-end](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/)". The somewhat broad and *fuzzy* intersection between design and back-end engineering.

I find Iâ€™m well suited to and ***enjoy roles that balance the user & developer experiences***, empowering teams to write great code in a way that feels right to them while ensuring a positive user experience. {.call-out}

Even though I've done this web building thing for a while now, I certainly haven't got it all figured out. I'm still learning and I imagine you are as well.
