Clive makes some good points.

> Me, I’ve been using Copilot for over a year now, and this is more or less how I use it: To help me quickly blast through boilerplate code so I can more quickly get to the tricky bits.

After giving some examples of trickier code that ChatGPT was asked to write&hellip;

> With each case, ChatGPT produced something that kind of worked — but not quite. The key thing is that it didn’t give up; it didn’t say “no, I can’t really do this.” It just confidently spouted code and said, *sure, I got this*. But it didn’t.
>
> &hellip;Now, the thing about bullshitting with code is that computers, unlike humans, quickly reject obvious bullshit. None of this bullshitted code actually runs!
>
> Ah, but *subtler* bullshit? That’ll run! As I’ve found in using Copilot, it’s quite possible for the AI to make subtler errors; the code will run at first, but quickly collapse when it hits an edge case. So one needs to be pretty vigilant even in using AI as an assistant.
