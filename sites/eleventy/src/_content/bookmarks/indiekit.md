Paul Robert Lloyd introduces his project, Indiekit.

> Today Iâ€™m formally launching [Indiekit](https://getindiekit.com/), the little Node.js server with all the parts needed to publish content to your personal website and share it on social networks.
>
> Think of Indiekit as the missing link between a statically generated website and the social web protocols developed by the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) community and recommended by the W3C.

Well worth reading his [blog post on launching it](https://paulrobertlloyd.com/articles/2022/12/indiekit/).
