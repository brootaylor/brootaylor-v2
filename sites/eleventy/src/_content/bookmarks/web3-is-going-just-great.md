I so appreciate Molly White’s voice on all things Web3 related.

Like she says&hellip;

> One of the most distinguishing features of "web3" is the sheer level of handwaviness surrounding it. While you can find no end of press releases, Twitter crypto bros, and venture capitalists extolling the virtues of web3, you will have a much harder time finding any definition that's not so full of buzzwords that it becomes meaningless.

This website, as well as [Molly’s personal writing on blockchain](https://blog.mollywhite.net/blockchain/), have some wonderfully articulated and compelling articles.

Well worth your time if you’re interested in another perspective - (and *possibly* some clarity) - on all of this stuff. It certainly can be bamboozling at times!
