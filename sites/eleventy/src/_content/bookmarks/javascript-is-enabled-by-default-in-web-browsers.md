title: JavaScript Is Enabled by Default in Web Browsers
summary: Browsers don’t turn off Javascript by default. And you don’t have to
  either. What’s important to note is that web experiences can work without it.

I like what [Michelle Barker has written here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/blog/introduction-to-web-sustainability/):

> You might think that any individual effort to reduce the web’s environmental impact is a drop in the ocean. But as tech workers, we are in a position of relative power compared to other industries. We build products that might be used by thousands, even millions of users. Any improvements we make have the potential for a vast impact when scaled up to that level.
