If you haven't come across [Jim Nielsen's blog](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/) yet, then there's no better time to start.

I love what he says in [this article](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/javascript-is-enabled-by-default/):

> Browsers don’t turn off Javascript by default. And you don’t have to either. What’s important to note is that web experiences can work without it (or before it).
>
> Building in layers of technology (HTML, CSS, JS — [in that order](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/meaning-in-web-tech-stack-ordering/)) is how the web is designed to work. It breeds resiliency.
>
> URLs lead to HTML which leads to CSS and JS. Start at the bottom layer and build up, ensuring new layers enhance on the layers beneath them and core functionality remains working if the technology breaks at any layer.
