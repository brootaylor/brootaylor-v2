Baldur Bjarnason is a god-send in these times of tech hype and bullshit. He's written a book, "[The Intelligence Illusion](https://illusion.baldurbjarnason.com/)", which I'm yet to read.

But, if like me, you donâ€™t have time to read the whole book just yet, he's also created an online guide of sorts. To help cut through some of the *AI bullshit*.

The website's called [needtoknow.fyi](https://needtoknow.fyi/).
