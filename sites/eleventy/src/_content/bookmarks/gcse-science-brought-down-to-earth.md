A lecture by [Professor Brian Cox](https://twitter.com/profbriancox) that happened nearly 10 years ago. I find it wonderfully compelling and uplifting especially at a time like this when we're tempted to stare at our navels for far too long.

If you're in need of something (like me) that'll lift your gaze a bit, grab a cuppa something and [watch it](https://youtu.be/enSXh4YY9Ws?t=517). Also worth a peak at [Quantum to Cosmos](https://quantumtocosmos.ca/) which lets you '*travel*' from the subatomic scale to the farthest reaches of the cosmos.
