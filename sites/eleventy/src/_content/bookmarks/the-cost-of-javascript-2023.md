This video *isn't* about bashing JavaScript. It's very much the opposite actually.

I think Addy does a great job at helping us understand the various pros and cons of using JavaScript in our modern web applications&hellip; and how *overusing* it client-side can have a really negative impact on the user experience.

Well worth a watch!
