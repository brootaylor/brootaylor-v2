Even though I found it a bit shocking &ndash; (according to a little [Twitter poll that Sara Soueidan ran](https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan/status/1498655196347604993) recently) &ndash; that relatively few people in the web industry know what Progressive Enhancement is, it’s also good to see it being talked about again.
