I've been a fan of [Icomoon](https://icomoon.io/) for years &mdash; *(and still am)* &mdash; but have recently discovered [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/).

I usually steer clear of Bootstrap in general but this looks like a great resource for SVG icons. Looks like they're already optimised and you can download them as is.

Very nice.
