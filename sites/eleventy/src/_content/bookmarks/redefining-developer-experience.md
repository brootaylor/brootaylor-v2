Pretty much everything that Cole Peters has written here resonates. Really good stuff and well worth the read.

> If I may risk verging on the idealistic, I would suggest that developer experience needs to pivot from a concept centered on feeling fast and living on the bleeding edge to one based on the enabling of developers to deliver reliable and first rate end user experiences — for as many users as possible, and for as long as possible. This doesn’t mean developers shouldn’t have great tools with which to carry out the crafting of great UX — but it does shift the narrative from one of ‘trickle down UX’ to something more honest, where the fruit of our labors is prioritized a little more above our labors themselves.
