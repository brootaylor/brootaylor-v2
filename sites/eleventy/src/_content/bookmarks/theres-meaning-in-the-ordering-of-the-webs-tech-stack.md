I like Jim's take on Zach’s presentation at JSHeroes 2023, [“The Good, The Bad, and The Web Components”](https://youtu.be/R4Ri4ft7bXY).

> We often see the web’s stack of technologies written together: “HTML, CSS, and JS”. What was reinforced to me from Zach’s presentation is that the ordering of this list of technologies has meaning.
