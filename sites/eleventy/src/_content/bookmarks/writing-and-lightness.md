I found this inspiring from Robin. Particularly because I often become unstuck when trying to write something. Especially when I'm trying too hard to make it *work*. I've lost count how many times I've just given up because *I didn't think it fitted*.

> Whenever I sit down in front of a keyboard I think of this now; I know that I can’t copy the tone and style of other people. And as much as I want to treat the writing seriously, and write something ~~important~~, I probably shouldn’t. I ought to write as if I’m talking; hopeful, bumbling, hands-waving and heart-skipping all the way.

Thanks Robin. Here's to just trying to be&hellip; me.
