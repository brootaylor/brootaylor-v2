I’ve been a follower of [Jem Bendell](https://jembendell.com/)’s work for a few years now and do find much of what he says & writes incredibly provocative, compelling and timely. This article is no exception.

His opening paragraph is quite the challenge. A challenge I’m not so sure I’m up for just yet. This Christmas anyhow. Albeit it important we talk about this difficult and uncomfortable topic, I often [trip over my own fears](/writing/2023-05-31/the-climate-crisis-what-to-make-of-it#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20it%20is%20a%20lonely%20journey%20because%20discussing%20this%20topic%20with%20family%20and%20friends%20isn’t%20the%20most%20popular%20of%20subjects.%20Finding%20individuals%20willing%20to%20engage%20in%20a%20genuine%20dialogue%2C%20to%20discuss%20and%20debate%20climate%20issues%20and%20their%20potential%20impact%20on%20us%2C%20is%20nearly%20impossible.%20Such%20conversations%20too%20often%20become%20triggers%20that%20end%20up%20straining%20relationships) of causing emotional stress to those I love &mdash; and if I'm completely honest, my fear of rejection from those dear to me.

  Over the years, my reticence to speak out has changed. That is because, although societal collapse is still taboo in mainstream media and politics, a huge proportion of the general public already experience how normal life is unravelling and that the ecological situation is unavoidably frightening. I want to help more people make sense of this situation and consider their options. As the initiative ‘Just Collapse’ often repeats, it is time to talk about societal collapse.
