Spot on list from Chris Ferdinandi &mdash; and man do some of these resonate. A real sanity check if you sometimes wonder whether you’re the *‘problem’* in interviews.

> Early career, its easy to think of job interviews as a sales pitch, where you’re the sales person trying to sell yourself to the company.
>
> While that’s partially true, the company (and person who will be your manager) should also be trying to sell themselves to you, and why you should want to work there.
>
> Over the years, I’ve started to notice a handful of red flags that make me walk away from interview processes early. They signal to me that a company will be a bad place to work after I’m hired.
