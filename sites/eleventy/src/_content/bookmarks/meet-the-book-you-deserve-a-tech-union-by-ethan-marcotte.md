Ethan Marcotte [announced his new book](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/you-deserve-a-tech-union-book/) a few months ago:

{% from "components/core/images/images.njk" import imageNormal %}
{{ imageNormal(
  "/assets/images/posts/bookmarks/you-deserve-a-tech-union-screenshot.png",
  "A screenshot of Ethan Marcotte's book cover; You Deserve a Tech Union",
  "1200",
  "1855",
  false,
  "shadow")
}}

I haven't ordered it yet but imagine I more than likely will do at some stage. I have deep respect for Ethan and have been positively affected &mdash; (*as a person & on a technical level*) &mdash; by pretty much everything I've read of his.

Known as the guy who started what we call "[Responsive Web Design](https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/)", he is one of the real gems in this *webby* industry of ours.

In the meantime, here's Ethan's [interview about the book](https://abookapart.com/blogs/press/meet-the-book-you-deserve-a-tech-union-by-ethan-marcotte).
