Wonderfully articulated by Jeremy. Provocatively profound!

> Here’s the thing: there’s good work and there’s working hard. What matters is doing good work. Often, to do good work you need to work hard. And so people naturally conflate the two, thinking that what matters is working hard. But whether you work hard or not isn’t actually what’s important. What’s important is that you do good work.
>
> If you can do good work without working hard, that’s not a bad thing. In fact, it’s great—you’ve managed to do good work *and* do it efficiently! But often this very efficiency is treated as laziness.

Jeremy goes on to say:

> But after a few decades of experience, I see no evidence for hard work as an intrinsically valuable activity, much less a useful measurement. If anything, I’ve seen the real harm that can be caused by tying your self-worth to how *much* you’re working. That way lies burnout.
>
> We no longer make people build famine walls or famine roads. But I wonder how many of us are constructing little monuments in our inboxes and calendars, filling those spaces with work to be done in an attempt to chase the rewards we’ve been told will result from hard graft.

The older I get, the more this resonates with me.
