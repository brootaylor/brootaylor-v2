**Emily M. Bender** said this when asked; "*Why do you dislike the term “generative AI?*”:

> I don’t have a problem with generative models. It’s true they are generating outputs. I dislike the term because “artificial intelligence” suggests that there’s more going on than there is, that these things are autonomous thinking entities rather than tools and simply kinds of automation. If we focus on them as autonomous thinking entities or we spin out that fantasy, it is easier to lose track of the people in the picture, both the people who should be accountable for what the systems are doing and the people whose labor and data are being exploited to create them in the first place.

And in response to another question:

> The threat is not the generative “AI” itself. It’s the way that management might choose to use it.
