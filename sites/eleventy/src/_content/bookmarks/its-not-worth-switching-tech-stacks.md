Read the entire article if you can as Jason makes some great points. Stuff of sanity in my opinion.

Leaving this as a taster for now&hellip;

> The JavaScript landscape is noisy. And it can be pushy. We hear a *lot* of opinions about what we should and shouldn’t be using to build websites.
>
> How do you choose when just about every JavaScript think piece contradicts the other advice you’ve seen and also insists that you need to learn the hot new thing?
>
> My hot take is that **a lot of developers tend to switch to new stacks as a way of kicking the can down the road on building features that users actually want and care about** &mdash; so the best tech stack is the one you can build something useful in today.
