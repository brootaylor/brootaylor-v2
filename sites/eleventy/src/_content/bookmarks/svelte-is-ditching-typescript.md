Oh, this is very interesting to hear from Rich Harris.

> “Now that SvelteKit is out, \[is] pretty widely used and stable at this point, our attention is going to switch back to Svelte itself,” Harris told The New Stack. “Right now we’re working on Svelte 4, which is going to modernize the codebase.”
>
> The team is switching the underlying code from TypeScript to JavaScript. That and the update will then allow the team to incorporate “big ideas” for Svelte 5 later this year, he added.

Rich had a bit [more to say on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Rich_Harris/status/1639344836766576640)&hellip;

> SvelteKit is written in JS and distributed as source code — no build step — and it's been miraculous for productivity. build steps make sense for apps, they make much less sense for libraries.
