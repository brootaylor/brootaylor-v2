Some much needed sanity from Addy Osmani on why it's worth [sticking to boring architecture for as long as possible](https://addyosmani.com/blog/boring-architecture/):

> In the tech world, FOMO can be a driving force behind our choices (we've often been there). However, it is not necessarily productive. While being aware of emerging technologies is important, chasing them without a clear value proposition can lead to needless complexity, technical debt, and resource drain.
>
> Before adopting a new technology, ask yourself: "Does it solve a specific problem or significantly enhance my product? Is it worth the learning curve and potential instability? Is this going to help us further down the line?"
