Baldur Bjarnason has [quite a bit to say on this subject](https://softwarecrisis.dev/letters/llmentalist/):

> Our current environment of relentless hype sets the stage and builds up an expectation for at least glimmers of genuine intelligence. For all the warnings vendors make about these systems not being general intelligences, those statements are always followed by either an implied or an actual “yet”. The hype strongly implies that these are “almost” intelligences and that you should be able to perceive “sparks” of intelligence in them.
