> Speed for the sake of speed means nothing. If our design systems don’t ultimately lead to better quality experiences, we’re doing it wrong.
>
> When we rush to release one-size-fits-all components, **without** doing the work to understand different contexts **before** curating and consolidating solutions, we sacrifice quality at the hands of speed.
>
> We undermine teams’ trust in the system from day one by providing brittle and poorly-researched solutions.
>
> We disappoint stakeholders who see teams choosing to continue working in silos over using an inadequate system.
>
> The irony? In the long run, this will slow us down. We end up having to undo the work we’ve done to fix the problems we’ve created.
>
> Ultimately, when we prioritise speed over quality, we end up with neither.
