This shout-out from [Cennydd's article](https://ethical.net/ethical/artificial-intelligence-who-owns-the-future/) is worth paying attention to:

> So now is the time to pay attention to what’s happening with AI and to ask questions. Ask how it is used in your public spaces, your schools, your workplaces, by your police, by your governments, by your militaries. Urge those in power to justify their decisions and discuss the safeguards they have put in place to ensure AI’s effects are positive. The issues involved are too important to be left to technologists.
