I'm having fun playing with [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) animation using [GreenSock](https://greensock.com/) at the moment. Cassie Evans and Jason Lengstorf's [Interactive SVG Animations Using Greensock](https://www.learnwithjason.dev/interactive-svg-animations-using-greensock) video provided a welcome spark of inspiration.
