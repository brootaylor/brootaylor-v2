I *prefer* a vanilla approach and tend to steer clear of using JavaScript frameworks if I can help it. Not that I have anything against JavaScript frameworks. I think they can be wonderfully powerful tools if we first keep the user in mind rather than prioritising the developer experience. At the moment I don't think we're getting that balance quite right.

Saying that, I think frameworks like [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [Astro](https://astro.build/), (and possibly [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)), are helping redress this imbalance.
