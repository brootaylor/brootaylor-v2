Am also considering dipping my toe in the [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) pond. In particular the SSR side of things and the <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getserversideprops-server-side-rendering"><code>getServerSideProps</code></a> facility it provides when needing authenticated areas on an SSG site.

But who knows when I'll find time for that!

*[SSR]: Server-Side Rendering.
*[SSG]: Static Site Generator.
