Much truth in this quote.

{% from "components/core/blockquotes/blockquotes.njk" import blockquote %}
{%- call blockquote('Ian Malcolm, Jurrasic Park') -%}
Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should.
{%- endcall %}

You could replace the “*Your scientists”* part with say… *“Big tech”…* and it still rings true.
