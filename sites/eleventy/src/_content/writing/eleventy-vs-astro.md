Every so often - (for some reason or other!) - I come back to the "Eleventy vs Astro". It's interesting cause I've mostly seen myself as somene who doesn't follow the tech trends just cause.

But here I am again asking the question... again. Interesting but also a bit odd seeing as I've been so happy with Eleventy. I love it and that it allows me to customise it as much or as little as I'd like. There's nothing opionated about it at all. I love this and do appreciate that Zach has built it this way.

Whenever I find myself coming back to the decision whether to stay with Eleventy or switch to Astro, there's always something that I choke on. And the most common one for me is the Astro namespace. For some reason I fucking hate having CSS class names named as something I had no say over. It's picky I know and honestly does seem like the weirdist of things to get irritated by. But hey, I do. So there.

Maybe it's just pride in me or some sort of resisteance to anything opinionated, but I'd really like a say over what the namespace is called. I'm happy with there being a namespace but I prefer to call it something I'd like. A name that belongs to me Just so it isn't clear that it *belongs* to some web framework or another - no matter how awesome it is.

Now this doesn't mean I'll never work with Astro. No. That would really be cutting off my nose to spite my face but I'm not sure I'd use it (just yet) on my personal website. I feel my personal website it the one space that can truly be me. Or, at least as much me as possible. A space that isn't tainted by other opinions. Weird I know.
