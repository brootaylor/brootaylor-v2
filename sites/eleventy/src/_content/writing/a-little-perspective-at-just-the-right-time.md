I was feeling completely overwhelmed. You see, I'm one of those that has the propensity to lose perspective if I don't regularly take a step back and look at the bigger picture. I'm a very detailed person with a fairly substantial dose of perfectionism chucked in. This, for all its pros, can prove to be a double-edged sword as well if I'm not careful.

That's why it was a moment of sanity for me when I read Andrew Clarke's article &mdash; "[It's 2014. Web Design Isn't Dead](https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/its-2014-web-design-isnt-dead)" &mdash; which was a follow-on from [Jeffrey Zeldman's article](https://www.zeldman.com/2014/01/06/its-2014-is-web-design-dead). They're both worth a read if you're anything like me and need a little perspective from time to time.

  At its root, perfectionism isn't really about a deep love of being meticulous. It's about fear. Fear of making a mistake. Fear of disappointing others. Fear of failure. Fear of success.
