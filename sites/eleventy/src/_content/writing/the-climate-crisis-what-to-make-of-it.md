I like many others are concerned about what I’m reading and experiencing. The information together with my own daily ‘experiences’ seem to confirm that our current ‘climate crisis’ is actually a thing.

But there are others that maintain there isn’t a crisis. That the mainstream information isn’t getting it right. That the data isn’t being represented truthfully and responsibly. That man’s effect on our climate is negligible and of no real effect. These people say that governing bodies like the IPCC are primarily a megaphone for the political agendas of countries and other powerful interests.

This can all seem really bamboozling for people like myself that are just asking for straight up facts. And if there aren’t any, then tell us that as well. Again, it seems those that lord it over us &mdash; (those that declare their expert status and demand they’re listened to) &mdash; have contributed to a dumbing-down effect. Where people like myself are left wondering whether it’s possible to make up our own minds about something. Whether we’re capable of researching, analysing and critiquing the available information and coming up with our own conclusions.

I’ve been trying to do just that for a few years now and find it hard to lift my head above my own fears and anxieties on this climate crisis matter and in particular what it may mean for my children and potential grandchildren. It can be difficult to see ‘clearly’ through lenses that are filtered with these fears and concerns.

It’s also a very lonely place as it’s not a popular subject to talk about with family and friends. I have found it all but impossible to find others that are willing to dialog, discuss and debate climate issues and what it may mean for us. It’s fraught with triggers that can end up shipwrecking relationships.

So, one ends up keeping it to themselves and walking a lonely road. That’s been my story and it’s not been a completely healthy one.
