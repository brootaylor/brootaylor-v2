Do not ask your children  
to strive for extraordinary lives.  
Such striving may seem admirable,  
but it is the way of foolishness.  
Help them instead to find the wonder  
and the marvel of an ordinary life.  
Show them the joy of tasting  
tomatoes, apples and pears.  
Show them how to cry  
when pets and people die.  
Show them the infinite pleasure  
in the touch of a hand.  
And make the ordinary come alive for them.  
The extraordinary will take care of itself.

&mdash; *William Martin, "The Parent's Tao Te Ching: Ancient Advice for Modern Parents"*
