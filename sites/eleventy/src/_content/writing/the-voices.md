So familiar  
So divergent  
So unwelcome  
Voices  
A melange  
Spewing their righteous counsel  
Their wisdom knows no bounds  
Mordacious  
Pointed  
Bony

The doubt  
Ooh the self doubt  
Like a sting  
No, more like an ache  
A deep ache  
In my bones  
Morning's buoyancy  
The hopes of a fresh start  
Quickly doused  
Smothered  
Drowned

The questions  
The accusations  
The insinuations  
Like a tightening noose  
"You ruined that friendship!"  
"Are you sure your motives are pure?"  
"Do you know what you've put your family through!?"  
"You're very average at your work"  
"Do you know what *those* people really think of you?"  
"Your wife finds you boring"  
"Your sons tolerate you"  
"Do you even know what you believe!?!"  
"Cheer up. You can't always be so intense"

This thick fog  
This icy mist  
These hooked thorns  
The tugging  
The tearing  
The stumbling  
The falling  
The..... silence  
Ooh... the *silence*

Where is the light?  
The Light  
The sun  
The Sun to burn this mist away.
