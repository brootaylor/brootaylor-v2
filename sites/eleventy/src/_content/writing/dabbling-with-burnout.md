More than I realise, last year took a lot out of me emotionally and mentally so I can feel I’m not hugely robust at the moment. I had an anxiety / panic attack about 2 weeks ago. It was completely unexpected. I’ve never had one before so wasn’t sure what was going on. It all kicked off at around 2am in the morning and I thought I was having a heart attack.

Very weird and frightening experience. jhgjhg

I could hear my heart beating loudly in my ears and feel it beating in my chest. And then, for some reason, it felt like everything slowed down. I felt very odd. Not quite right. I sat up and tried to calm my breathing but couldn’t. Nausea, hot flushes and then tingling in my finger tips, toes and lips started and I could feel myself about to pass out.
