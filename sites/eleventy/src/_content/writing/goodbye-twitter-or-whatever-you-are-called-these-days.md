Twitter, we've certainly had an on-and-off relationship over the years haven't we!

Numerous times, I've allowed you to creep back into my life &mdash; *(who the heck knows why!)* &mdash;only to discover that you often do me more harm than good. You have a knack for making me feel awful about myself and my place in this world.

**Every single time**.

Of course, I can't solely lay the blame at your doorstep. I'm equally complicit in this unhealthy affair. My desire to belong, to have my voice heard, to be noticed, to feel valued. This need occasionally clouds my judgment and leads me to forget why I walked away from you in the first place. I mean, I *even* reopened the door to Facebook recently, a platform I had abandoned over a decade ago!

Apart from <abbr title="I'm referring to Twitter here.">**you**</abbr> and Facebook, LinkedIn is the other <abbr title="I honestly have no idea what to call these platforms anymore.">**thingy**</abbr> I've given time and energy to. Until fairly recently, I was under the illusion that LinkedIn was somehow different and that I *needed* it to network professionally. After all, how could I find my next job without it, right?

Alas, it seems it too has just become [another place on the web that taps into the narcissistic tendencies lying within us human folk](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedin-losing-its-way-dr-reg-butterfield/).

  My experience of using LinkedIn for many years is that it seems to have moved from a business-oriented platform to just another social media site such as Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook. Am I really coming to LinkedIn to see family portraits and clever animal tricks? Even worse, heart-breaking stories that are fantasies written to accrue clicks!

I've decided not to delete my Twit&hellip; "X" account and all its data just yet. Mainly because I think some of my posts serve as markers in my life over the past few years. In due course, I may well change my mind on this.

So, for the foreseeable future, here's a [link to my Twitter / "X" / whatever-it's-called-right-now](https://twitter.com/brootaylor).

And, because my *intention* is to never return, here's a link to [my last tweet&hellip; or whatever it's called these days](https://twitter.com/brootaylor/status/1699779963644531026).

Going forward, I think I'll be giving more of my time and attention to my personal website and blog. I have no idea how many people even come across it or even bother to read anything I've written here. But hey, I don't want that to matter.

To put it differently; *I don't want to **need** that to matter*.

This blog is mine. All mine. If someone&hellip; if <abbr title="Meaning an actual 'you' this time. ðŸ˜Š">you</abbr> happen to come across it and end up reading some of my rambles &mdash; then I'm grateful and sincerely hope you found it did you good.

In addition to being somewhat cathartic, I hope this post serves as a reminder to my future self to exercise caution when considering letting <abbr title="I'm referring to Twitter here.">**you**</abbr> back into my life. {.call-out}

Adios!
