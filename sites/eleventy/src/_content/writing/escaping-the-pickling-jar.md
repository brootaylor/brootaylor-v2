Pickled beyond recognition  
Partly because of my own carnal ambition  
A dear price to pay for self-preservation  
It seems I have been serving a god of my own religion.  

Is there a way to escape this toxic juice?  
Or do I just hold up a flag and declare a truce  
God have mercy, for I have lost my way  
All because of my propensity to stray.  

Now I know my faith is weak  
But I donâ€™t believe your plan for me is bleak  
A growing longing to see again  
And to trust your great promises are Yes and Amen.
