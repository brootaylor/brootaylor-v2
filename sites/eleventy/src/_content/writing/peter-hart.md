A hero to me. An unsung hero to many. A selfless frontline NHS Emergency Practitioner who's kind and caring fingerprints can be seen everywhere. Hart by name, H(e)art by nature as many others have so wonderfully described this gem of a man.

I'm finding it really hard to come to terms with the fact that I won't see Pete again. That I won't be able to sit in a coffee shop or on the patio with my mate Pete again and just shoot the breeze. That I won't hear his infectious laugh. That I won't get to see his kind eyes and warm smile, or experience his great big bear of a hug.

I just can't believe it.

There is so much that I could (and want to) write about Pete but my emotions are far too raw for that right now. I'll need to save it for another time I think.

But, for now. In this moment. I remember this beautiful man.

Goodbye dear dear Pete. Rest easy my friend&hellip; and happy birthday.

I'm going to miss you terribly. ðŸ˜˜
