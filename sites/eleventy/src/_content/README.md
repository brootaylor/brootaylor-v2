# `_content` directory

This directory holds all the `.md` content files. These files typically contain a mixture of **front matter** (which is used as data) and **markdown** (which is transformed into HTML) when it's compiled.

The idea is to separate the content from the code as much as possible. In theory, all the content in here could be moved to a CMS if that was needed.
