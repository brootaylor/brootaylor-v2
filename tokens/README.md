# Design Tokens

This is where the design token key value pairs are defined.

These values should ideally be defined by a global 'Design System' of sorts. The actual values could be supplied in a universal (friendly format) like this - ie. JSON.

Maybe they could come from...

* A Sketch or Figma file (automatically generated)?
* Or generated by a UI dev process that pushes the values to a public repo that other projects can pull in as a dependency.

**Probably needs more thought**.
